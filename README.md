# KFLEX: A Fast and Efficient Framework for Counting and Manipulating kmers
KFLEX is an advanced framework designed for efficiently handling kmers in large genomic datasets. Using **Sparse Motif Tree (SMT)** (for more information about what is SMT, click [here](https://github.com/jadermcg/smt)) as its basic infrastructure, kflex was designed to optimize both RAM memory usage and processing time.

One of KFLEX's most notable features is its ability to work with large volumes of data without sacrificing efficiency. This is achieved through the use of kmer minimizers, which allow for a compact and effective representation of kmers. Additionally, the SMT structure contributes to rapid storage and retrieval of kmers, making KFLEX a robust solution for applications that require high performance and efficiency.

Whether you are a researcher, a bioinformatician or a developer, KFLEX offers a reliable and efficient solution for all your kmer-related needs.
